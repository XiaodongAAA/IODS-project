## A short discription of the course
This course--Introduction to Open Data Science--is aimed to help students to understand the principles and advantages of using open research tools with open data and understand the possibilities of reproducible research. After learning this course the students should know how to use R, RStudio, RMarkdown and GitHUb and also know how to learn more of these open software tools. Beside, and also the most important for me, the students will also know how to apply certain statistical methods of data science.
